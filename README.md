# Introduction
The solution included with this document is an exercise to allow you to demonstrate knowledge of modern design principals/patterns. It is not production code – in fact you may find it demonstrates poor practice (it is not representative of the code we produce at Zest).

We’d like you to approach this in the same way you would your day-to-day development, however there is no right answer.

We will use this to gauge your thought process, and see how it aligns with ours.

If we move to a face to face interview, we will discuss your work in more depth.

# Getting Started
The solution is based around a fictional tyre distributor and their ordering system.

The TyreDistributor.Tests project contains an OrderTests test class, which tests the Order class in the main project.

The ‘Order’ class contains the majority of the functionality in the solution.

# Objectives / Time Limit
We would like to see:
-	refactoring to improve the code as you see fit, such as utilising SOLID design principles and/or other design patterns.
-	the tests still pass
-	that you focus on the areas you deem most important (we care more about your overall approach than minor syntactical issues)
-	that where you haven’t had time to fully refactor, you have added comments to highlight what you may do if given more time
-	there is no strict time limit but we think 1-2 hours should be sufficient. Please let us know how long you spend and any observations you wish to share when you send us your code.

# Making changes and sending us your code
## GitHub
The best way is to:
- fork this GitHub repository using the 'Fork' option at the top of this page. This will ensure you have your own copy under your own GitHub account.
- connect your editor (VS/VS Code etc) to your forked repository in GitHub
- make any changes ensuring you push those changes up to GitHub (under your own forked respository)
- send us a link to your GitHub repository so that we can review your changes.

## Zip
Alternatively you can (this can be less reliable as the zip file can get caught by spam or virus filters):
- download the code from this repository using the 'code' button
- make your changes offline
- send us a copy of your code in a zip file
